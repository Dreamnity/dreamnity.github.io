Overview
Our goal at Dreamnity is to ensure that you receive the best service possible. We understand that there may be instances where our platform does not meet your needs, particularly in finding a suitable freelancer match. In such cases, we offer a refund policy to ensure you can cash out your website credits immediately or, if you prefer, pay an additional fee to see a list of freelancers that match your budget.
</p>
<p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 dark:text-primary-200/70 sm:text-lg text-justify">
1. No Freelancer Match Found: If you are unable to find a suitable freelancer for your project immediately after posting the job, you can request a refund of your website credits.
</p>
<p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 dark:text-primary-200/70 sm:text-lg text-justify">
2. Freelancer Issues: If the freelancer you engaged with:
   - Fails to start the project as agreed.
   - Does not meet the agreed milestones or deadlines without a valid reason.
   - Delivers work that is significantly below the agreed-upon standards or requirements.
</p>
<p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 dark:text-primary-200/70 sm:text-lg text-justify">
Refund Process
To request a refund, please follow these steps:
1. Refund Button: From the dashboard you need to click refund button and enter the amount of credits you need as refund.
2. Refund after match: Contact on site moderator and explain the situation, as moderator closes the chat you will be able to see refund button.
2. Review and Verification: Our team will review your request and verify the circumstances. This process may involve communication with the freelancer to understand both perspectives.
3. Approval and Refund: If your refund request is approved, the equivalent amount of your website credits will be processed and returned to your original payment method within 3 business days.
</p>
<p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 dark:text-primary-200/70 sm:text-lg text-justify">
Alternative Option
If you are unable to find a freelancer match immediately, you have the option to pay an additional fee to access a curated list of freelancers that match your budget. This option provides an expanded search to help you find the right professional for your project.
</p>
<p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 dark:text-primary-200/70 sm:text-lg text-justify">
